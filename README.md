# Computer Graphics Final Assignment

Assignment 6 of UCD's Winter 2022 Computer Graphics class tested knowledge of shading, bump mapping, and included all of the other graphical applications covered previously of linear algebraic data manipulation for the proper viewing of the objects and moving of the camera, as well as some other smaller utility topics such as the loading of each model's data by JSON parsing. The culmination is a deeper understanding of how Computer Graphics are implemented in software as well as what data the GPU requires, and how to give it such, to produce the desired result.
